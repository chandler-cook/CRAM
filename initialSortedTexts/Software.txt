For the purpose of this challenge, assumethat the company proprietary software applications that provide the functions described mapped in section 3.3 do not have any known vulnerabilities.  The CommonVulnerability and Exposure (CVE) numbers provided in the table are reference numbers for a given vulnerability used on the MITRE CVE website.  The NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) that includes the CVEs and they assign a Common VulnerabilityScoring System (CVSS) score to each vulnerability to recommend a severity rating if the vulnerability were successfully exploited.  The NVD also provides aCVSS Calculator to allow cybersecurity engineers to adjust the default NVD CVSS score for a given vulnerability if it is deemed appropriate.  Some of the NVDCVSS scores use the Version 2 calculator while others use the Version 3.x calculator, so when both CVSS scores are provide for a given vulnerability the Versionvulnerabilities for any additional system configurations they would like to demonstrate, but the vulnerabilities listed in the tables should be demonstrated for theinitial demonstration run.  This initial demonstration run may also include removing one or more vulnerabilities from the assessment as would be done if the ITstaff apply security software patches to the information system in order to remediate vulnerabilities, and then a new cyber resiliency assessment score will beMITRE CVE Search: https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.htmlNIST NVD Search: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/searchNIST NVD CVSS Version 3.1 Calculator: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculatorNIST NVD CVSS Version 2 Calculator: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v2-calculatorTable 3.4-1.

For the purpose of this challenge, assumethat the company proprietary software applications that provide the functions described mapped in section 3.3 do not have any known vulnerabilities.  The CommonVulnerability and Exposure (CVE) numbers provided in the table are reference numbers for a given vulnerability used on the MITRE CVE website.  The NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) that includes the CVEs and they assign a Common VulnerabilityScoring System (CVSS) score to each vulnerability to recommend a severity rating if the vulnerability were successfully exploited.  The NVD also provides aCVSS Calculator to allow cybersecurity engineers to adjust the default NVD CVSS score for a given vulnerability if it is deemed appropriate.  Some of the NVDCVSS scores use the Version 2 calculator while others use the Version 3.x calculator, so when both CVSS scores are provide for a given vulnerability the Versionvulnerabilities for any additional system configurations they would like to demonstrate, but the vulnerabilities listed in the tables should be demonstrated for theinitial demonstration run.  This initial demonstration run may also include removing one or more vulnerabilities from the assessment as would be done if the ITstaff apply security software patches to the information system in order to remediate vulnerabilities, and then a new cyber resiliency assessment score will beTable 3.4-1.
