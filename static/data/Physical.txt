The layout is designed to accommodate various departments and activities, including engineering, production, testing, and management.The Engineering & Production area occupies a significant portion of the space, with multiple workstations, a conference table, a printer, and a shredder. There's also a meeting laptop and a product test table, indicating a focus on collaboration and hands-on work.The Production Floor Space, not part of the challenge evaluation, is at the bottom of the plan and includes a workbench area, indicating a place where products are manufactured or assembled.The diagram also includes a note at the bottom explaining that the company mail and web services are on the Virtualization Manager Server inside the information system perimeter, and there is no Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) implemented between the Internet and the Boundary Firewall. This was done to save money and because the Virtualization Manager Server had a spare processing resource.
