Next to it is the Main Lobby, furnished with seating and a security guard station. The lobby leads to the Company Management Office Suite Space, which has a window and a PIN keypad.The Test Lab is located to the right of the Engineering & Production area, equipped with a product test table and a separate area for tester laptops, suggesting a dedicated testing environment.The space is also connected to the internet, as indicated by a cloud symbol, and there are windows for natural light throughout the office. The entire layout is neatly organized, with clear demarcations between different areas.This image is a network diagram representing a Cyber Defensive Capability Performance Measurement Development Challenge System under evaluation. The system includes various components such as workstations, servers, switches, and firewalls connected via the internet and an internal network. The workstations are grouped into different categories, such as Engineering & Production and Test Engineering, and are connected to different servers and storage devices. There is also a System Administrator Terminal, and a Boundary Firewall with an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is depicted to provide security. The network uses a combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches, and there is a note that specifies the meaning of the line symbols used in the diagram.Starting from the top, the internet is connected to a Boundary Firewall with an IPS. From the firewall, there are multiple paths connecting to various workstations and servers. The workstations are grouped into categories such as Engineering & Production (Workstation 1-6) and Test Engineering (Workstation 1-4), each connected to different servers and storage devices. For example, Engineering & Production Workstation 1 connects to a Virtualization Manager Server, a Cybersecurity Capability & Tools Server, and an Audit Log Server, while Test Engineering Workstation 1 connects to a Test SAN and an Engineering & Production SAN Archive. The servers are also grouped into categories such as SR (Storage Repository) servers and Management servers. The storage includes SAN (Storage Area Network) Archives and Company Management SAN Archives.The network uses a combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches for connectivity. There are two Layer 2 switches (Switch 1 and Switch 2) that seem to connect the workstations to the Layer 3 Switch (Router). The Layer 3 Switch then appears to connect to the servers and storage devices. Additionally, there is a note that explains the meaning of the line symbols used in the diagram, indicating that a single line represents 5 different cables connecting to 5 different ports on the switch.The boundary firewall with an IPS is used to provide security to the network. It is connected to the internet, and the system administrator terminal is connected to it, suggesting that it may be used for remote access or monitoring purposes.This image displays a collection of computer-related items, each labeled with its respective name. At the top, there are two identical 24" LCD monitors, each displaying a blue abstract wallpaper with white lines and light rays emanating from a central point. Below the monitors, there is a separate image of a computer tower accompanied by a keyboard and a mouse. The computer tower is black with a silver mesh front panel and features a white Dell logo in the center. The keyboard is black with white keys, and the mouse has a silver body with a black scroll wheel.
