1. No Flood or Environmental Risk Mitigation:
   - The facility is located in a floodplain but lacks any flood barriers or water detection systems. There are no emergency plans for flood response or evacuation.
   
2. Unsecured Main Entrance:
   - The main entrance is staffed by a part-time security guard with no access controls. During off-hours, doors are left unlocked, and there is no mechanism to verify door closure or prevent unauthorized entry.
   - No access control systems are installed on any doors; entry is granted based solely on verbal verification or recognition.

3. Non-Existent After-Hours Security:
   - No alarm systems are installed on any facility entry points, leaving the building entirely unmonitored after hours. Any individual could enter the facility without detection or response.

 Information Technology (IT) Equipment Room Security

4. Open Access to IT Room:
   - The IT equipment room is unlocked and accessible to all employees without any access controls. 
   - No locking mechanisms are in place for any equipment racks or storage cabinets, making it easy for unauthorized individuals to tamper with or remove equipment.

5. Inadequate Physical Security for Engineering and Production Areas:
   - There is no keycard access or other control measures. Visitors can freely enter and exit the Engineering and Production areas without any form of monitoring or restriction.

6. Product Testing Room:
   - The Product Testing room has no electronic or manual locks, motion detectors, or surveillance cameras, allowing unrestricted access at all times.

7. Unsecured Management Offices:
   - The Management offices do not have any form of access control. Doors are left open and accessible to anyone in the building, leaving sensitive information and equipment vulnerable.

 Information System and Cybersecurity Policies

8. Outdated IT Staff Training:
   - IT staff have no formal cybersecurity certifications and are not required to undergo any training. The organization has no cybersecurity training programs, leaving staff unaware of common security threats.

9. Nonexistent Firewall and Intrusion Prevention:
   - The network lacks a firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS). Network traffic flows freely without any filtering or monitoring, exposing the system to external threats.
  
10. Unsupported Equipment and No Patch Management:
    - Hardware and software components are outdated, with many reaching end-of-life without replacement or support. There is no patch management schedule, and security patches are rarely, if ever, applied.

11. No Vulnerability Scanning or Monitoring:
    - No vulnerability scanners are in use. System vulnerabilities remain unmonitored, leaving the network susceptible to both known and unknown threats.

12. Lack of Role-Based Access Control:
    - All users have administrative access across systems, with no role-based access control (RBAC) policies enforced. There are no access reviews, making it easy for unauthorized personnel to gain access to sensitive data.

 Vulnerability Overview of System Components

 Network and System Hardware:
- Outdated Network Devices:
  - The network operates on unsupported Cisco 2600 Series Routers and Switches from 1999, with no firmware updates applied.
- Insecure Server Configurations:
  - Servers are running unpatched versions of Windows NT 4.0 with critical vulnerabilities that remain unaddressed. No server is equipped with antivirus or security monitoring tools.
