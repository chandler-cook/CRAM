The system includes various components such as workstations, servers, switches, and firewalls that are connected via a network. The network is divided into different sections, such as Engineering & Production, Test, and Company Management, with each section having specific workstations and servers. There are also SAN (Storage Area Network) devices, including Archive and Backup servers, distributed throughout the system. The system uses a variety of hardware and software, including Boundary Firewall with Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Layer 3 Switch (Router), and Cybersecurity Capability & Tools Server. The network appears to be designed for high availability and redundancy, as indicated by the multiple connections and backup systems present.The image depicts a technical rack labeled "Boundary Defense and System Administration Rack." This rack contains various hardware components including:1. At the top, there's a Cisco Firepower 4125 with IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), which is likely used for network security.2. Below the IPS, there's a Cisco Meraki MS425-32 Layer 3 Switch, which acts as a router and manages network traffic.3. Next, there's a Cisco Catalyst 2960-X Ethernet Switch, which is used for connecting multiple devices within a network.5. Further down, there are several PowerEdge R750 ESXi Servers, which are virtualization servers that can run virtual machines.6. Adjacent to the ESXi servers, there are PowerVault ME5024 SANS (Storage Area Networks), which are used for storing data securely.7. There's also a patch panel, which is a device that allows for the connection of various cables to different devices.This image is a visual representation of a server rack setup, likely used in an IT environment. The rack contains various hardware components organized in a vertical manner within a metal frame. The front of the rack has a series of bays where the hardware components are installed. Each bay has a corresponding label indicating the type of hardware installed, such as PowerEdge R750 ESXi Servers, PowerVault ME5024 SAN, and Cisco Catalyst switches. The labels also categorize the hardware by function, like 'Engineering & Production' and 'Test', or by department, like 'Company Management'. Additionally, there are labels indicating the power status of the devices, such as 'ON', 'OFF', and 'STANDBY'. The image also includes labels that provide information on the configuration of the servers and switches, like 'SR1' and 'SR12' for server rack slots. The bottom of the rack has a patch panel, which is used for connecting cables between devices. The rack is also equipped with an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), ensuring that the hardware remains operational during power outages.This image displays two different types of computer components and accessories. On the top, there are two 24" LCD monitors, each with a dynamic blue abstract wallpaper. Below the monitors, there is a label indicating the content, but it is not visible in the image. On the bottom left, there is a computer tower with a keyboard and mouse placed in front of it. The computer tower is black with a mesh front panel, and it has a Dell logo on it. The keyboard is a standard QWERTY layout with a dark color, and the mouse has a silver color with a scroll wheel and two buttons.This image showcases a collection of different items, likely related to technology or data management. The items are displayed in pairs, with each item accompanied by a brief description of its features or purpose. The items include a rugged laptop with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system and Apache Open Office, a tower with a direct attached storage (DAS) system, six 3.5" 10 TB SATA hard drives, a USB-C 3.2 interface that is backward compatible to USB 3.0 or older versions, a durable hard shell equipment travel case, a power strip with multiple outlets, and a bundle of various cables and miscellaneous equipment.
