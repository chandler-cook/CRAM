MRZTech customers are extremely satisfied with therequires MRZTech to maintain certain critical functions for internal operations at all times in order to meet thecustomer’s needs.  Figure 1.0-1 illustrates the MRZTech facility layout.  It consists of discrete spaces for the workareas: (a) Engineering and Production management, (b) Test Engineering, (c) Production floor (not part of thisalso has a Main Lobby area for visitors and during normal business hours there is a Security Guard to control visitoraccess to the facility.

The floor plan is organized with different sections such as the Information Technology Equipment Room, Engineering & Production area, Main Lobby, Company Management Office Suite Space, and a Production Floor Space. Each section contains specific furniture and equipment like servers, workstations, a conference table, a printer, a shredder, and a test lab. The floor plan also shows windows, doors, and other architectural features like a main entrance and an exit.[Image 2]:In the diagram, there are specific notes that provide additional information about the network configuration. For example, the note on the bottom left indicates that the company mail and web services are on the Virtualization Manager Server inside the information system perimeter. It also mentions that there is no Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) implemented between the Internet and the Boundary Firewall, which was done to save money and because the Virtualization Manager Server had a spare processing resource.[Image 3]:4. Below the switches, there's a computer monitor, which is typically used for system management, monitoring, or troubleshooting purposes.8. At the bottom of the rack, there's an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), which provides backup power to the equipment.[Image 4]:[Image 5]:The image depicts a bulk data storage rack. It consists of various components, each labeled with its function or type. At the top, there are three Cisco Catalyst 2960-X Ethernet Switches. Below the switches, there are multiple Dell PowerVault ME5024 SANs, categorized into different types such as Engineering & Production Archive, Backup, Test Archive, Cybersecurity Capability & Tools Archive Backup, and Company Management Archive. There's also a patch panel and an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) at the bottom of the rack. Each component is visually represented with a gray metallic box, and the labels are written in black text on the front of these boxes.[Image 6]:[Image 7]:
