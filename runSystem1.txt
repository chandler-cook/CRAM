3.4 Information System Cyber Vulnerabilities Lists.

Tables 3.4-1 through 3.4-5 list the vulnerabilities that are present on the company information system under evaluation. For the purpose of this challenge, assume
that all computer Ports, Protocols, and Services (PPS) needed to exploit each listed vulnerability are enabled on the endpoint and network devices. Also assume
that the company proprietary software applications that provide the functions described mapped in section 3.3 do not have any known vulnerabilities. The Common
Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) numbers provided in the table are reference numbers for a given vulnerability used on the MITRE CVE website. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) that includes the CVEs and they assign a Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS) score to each vulnerability to recommend a severity rating if the vulnerability were successfully exploited. The NVD also provides a
CVSS Calculator to allow cybersecurity engineers to adjust the default NVD CVSS score for a given vulnerability if it is deemed appropriate. Some of the NVD
CVSS scores use the Version 2 calculator while others use the Version 3.x calculator, so when both CVSS scores are provide for a given vulnerability the Version
3.x calculator value should be used for this exercise. Below are the links to the MITRE and NIST websites. The challenge participants may add additional
vulnerabilities for any additional system configurations they would like to demonstrate, but the vulnerabilities listed in the tables should be demonstrated for the
initial demonstration run. This initial demonstration run may also include removing one or more vulnerabilities from the assessment as would be done if the IT
staff apply security software patches to the information system in order to remediate vulnerabilities, and then a new cyber resiliency assessment score will be
calculated.

3.5 Example Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

Participants can choose to include any desired information on APTs that is publicly available. MITRE hosts a list of APTs at Groups | MITRE ATT&CK® and
details known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). An example list of possibly applicable APTs is provided below, but the list of possibly applicable
APTs is not exhaustive. The APTs selected do not represent specific areas of concern, and no specific interest in the SUE is expected. However, information
from these APTs should be included as examples of commonly known TTPs. As such, the initial demonstration run should include at a minimum TTPs from

these groups. The initial demonstration run may also include adding or removing an APT and their TTPs.

e APT1 -APT1, Comment Crew, Comment Group, Comment Panda, Group G0006 | MITRE ATT&CK®
e Sandworm Team - Sandworm Team, ELECTRUM, Telebots, IRON VIKING, BlackEnergy (Group), Quedagh, Voodoo Bear, IRIDIUM, Group G0034

Some additional company facility and information system characteristics to consider are:
a. Company facility is next to a river and is in the flood plain.

b. Company facility implements some physical security measures to include a Security Guard desk at the main
entrance that is staffed Monday-Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The main entrance is locked when the Guard is
not on duty but allows employees to exit if they work late (sometimes the door does not close all the way if
employees do not make sure it catches). The production staff are responsible for opening the production floor
door in the morning and locking it at the end of each day using a key lock, and all production staff have the
key. An after-hours alarm system that only monitors the main entrance door and the production floor door is
implemented and it is monitored by a commercial service over a telephone line link. All employees know the
alarm code in the event they need to work late or have to come into work over the weekend. The last employee
leaving the facility in the evening is responsible for activating the alarm.

c. Company has an equipment room that contains all the Information Technology (IT) equipment racks and the
room has a single door with a key lock. All the IT staff have the door key and the door is usually left unlock
during normal business hours but it is supposed to be locked whenever there is no IT staff present in the room
per the company policy. The IT staff does not always lock the door if they step out and “expect” to be back in
15 minutes or less. The equipment racks in the space do not have locks and neither does the equipment spares
cabinet.

d. Company has a room for the Engineering and Production staff and it has a single entrance door but there is not
door lock or any other physical access control mechanism. The believe is that the Security Guard at the main
entrance will control visitors and all the company staff is trusted.

e. Company has a room for the product test and evaluation, and it has a single door but it is accessed through the
Engineering and Production room. It also does not have a key lock or any other physical access control
mechanism.

f. Company Management offices are comprised of a suite of rooms that are accessed from a single door. That
door has a key lock to secure the office space after hours. The door is unlocked during normal business hours
but a PIN keypad is used to gain access. The individual offices in the management suite do not have locks on
their doors.

g. Assume the company Product floor is all Industrial Control System (ICS) components that is standalone with
no computer network connections to the company information system under evaluation. The production ICS
is not part of this challenge. There is a door between the Engineering and Production space and the Production
floor. It has a key lock but no one really uses it (and they can’t find the key) and there is no other physical
access control mechanism being used.

h. The company uses proprietary application software for all the engineering and production, test engineering,
and company management functions. This proprietary application software will not be part of the system under
evaluation for this challenge.

i. The IT staff has a mix of training and experience. Some IT staff have received IT and cybersecurity
certifications in the past but they have since expired. Other staff have had some IT training but limited on-the-
job experience and they have had no cybersecurity training. One IT staff member has years of IT and
cybersecurity experience, has formal technical education, and has a number of IT and cybersecurity
certifications. This single staff member seems to be doing the vast majority of the work and they are
overworked. They were hired into the company within the past 6 months to improve the information system
security, but the system architecture is already deployed and there is no funding to make improvements until
next year.

j. Information system boundary Firewall Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rulesets are not up-to-date.

k. Some of the hardware and software components within the company information system have reached “end-
of-life”. This means that the component manufacturer no longer supports the hardware or software item, and
as a result will not provide security patches to firmware or software for any newly discovered vulnerabilities.

1. Nodes within the company information system have not had the latest security patches installed leaving open
vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities have been known for some time but can not be patched since some of the
application software providing critical functions will stop working.

1.0 Introduction.

This document describes the System Under Evaluation (SUE) that will be used for the Cyber Defensive Capability
Performance Measurement Development Challenge, Phase 3 Demonstration and it can be referenced by the
participants during their solution development and test during the challenge Phase 2. It is intended to establish a
minimum baseline SUE that all challenge teams will use during their solution demonstration. Challenge teams may
develop additional SUE configurations to further demonstrate their solution capability within the timeframe assigned
for the Phase 3 Demonstration Brief presentation and solution demonstration.

To further illustrate the intent of the challenge objectives, this document will present a fictional scenario based on a
small business company named “MRZTech” that develops, tests, and fields, and sustains high technology products
that are in high demand and fulfill a unique market niche. MRZTech customers are extremely satisfied with the
products, and they have become key components within the critical missions for these customer organizations. This
requires MRZTech to maintain certain critical functions for internal operations at all times in order to meet the
customer’s needs. Figure 1.0-1 illustrates the MRZTech facility layout. It consists of discrete spaces for the work
areas: (a) Engineering and Production management, (b) Test Engineering, (c) Production floor (not part of this
challenge evaluation), (d) Information Technology and Cybersecurity, and (e) Company Management. The facility
also has a Main Lobby area for visitors and during normal business hours there is a Security Guard to control visitor
access to the facility. There may be some problems with the facility layout that could impact the company’s cyber
resiliency in the event of an outsider threat or insider threat event. Competitor companies and foreign governments
very much was access to MRZTech’s products design artifacts and test data as well as the unique Intellectual Property
(IP) information that the company has created.

The company implements the common workstation configuration depicted in Figure 3.2.4-1 for the engineering and
production and company management work areas. The test engineering work area uses the laptop configuration
depicted in Figure 3.2.4-2. Laptops are used to allow for testing of the product items on the Test Lab table as well as
on the production floor and in the field. The laptops will use a direct attached bulk storage tower when testing on the
production floor or in the field. The collected test data will then be transferred onto the Test SANS once the laptops
are reconnected to the company information system. The company does not have any kind of asset control process

for the hard drives used within the direct attached bulk storage tower. Tables 3.2.4-1 and 3.2.

4-2 provide the company

workstation hardware and software configuration, respectively. Tables 3.2.4-3 and 3.2.4-4 provide the test laptop

hardware and software configuration, respectively.

3.2.3 Bulk Data Storage Rack

The Bulk Data Storage Rack is illustrated in Figure 3.2.3-1, and it contains multiple Dell PowerVault Storage Area
Network (SAN) units. This rack provides the archive storage the facility engineering and production, test engineering,
IT and cybersecurity, and company management work areas. The IT cybersecurity data will be encrypted at rest on
dedicated SANS drives. The company products technical data and test data assessed as sensitive Intellectual Property
data and any other company sensitive data will be encrypted at rest and stored on dedicated SANS drives. The
company also implements automatic archive replication to a backup SANS within the same equipment rack in the
event of the primary archive failure. The SANS storage on the rack includes:

a. Provide the bulk data storage location for all data collected during IT operations and cybersecurity monitoring
and cyber incident response.

b. Store product Intellectual Property and any other company sensitive data, such as financial records and
contract agreements.

c. Store product test and analysis data and test reports.

d. Store company sensitive financial data, legal data to include contracts data, human resources data, payroll
data, and any other company sensitive data.

The Cisco Catalyst Layer 2 (Ethernet) switches interconnect the SAN components and connect to the Layer 3 switch
(router) in the Boundary Defense and System Administration Rack (section 3.2.1). A patch panel will provide a
central cable management point for all the internal equipment interconnection in the rack. It will also allow for easier
reconfiguration of the rack interconnect if it becomes necessary. An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) will be
included within the Bulk Data Storage Rack that will provide temporary emergency power when the primary facility
power circuit is interrupted allowing for a graceful shutdown of the equipment within the rack or until any backup
emergency power source is engaged. Tables 3.2.3-1 and 3.2.3-2 provide the hardware and software list, respectively,
for the Bulk Data Storage Rack.

m. Nessus vulnerability scanner has not been updated with the latest plugins, where a single plugin performs an
automated test to detect the presence of a specific known vulnerability on a commercial hardware or software
item. This has resulted in the IT staff performing vulnerability scans on the system in compliance with company
policy but are not detecting the new vulnerabilities on the information system.

The Information Technology (IT) staff have implemented user accounts processes and monitoring procedures
and have implemented Role Based Access Control (RBAC) with four defined roles:

System Administrator (SA) — The SA role has “root” level privileges to all IT equipment, cybersecurity
capability and tools, and all data stored on the workstations and laptops, servers, and SANS storage
locations to include the Archive and Archive Backup locations. All IT staff are assigned the SA role
and the IT staff is responsible for performing all cybersecurity tasks and data management tasks.

Engineering and Production (EP) — The EP role has “owner” privileges to all software applications and
tools used during product and system development, configuration management, integration, production,
fielding, and sustainment. This role also has access to all the engineering and production data for all the
company projects. All the company engineering and production staff are assigned the EP role.

Test Engineering (TE) — The TE role has “owner” privileges to all the software applications used to test
the company products during development and integration as well as the production units. The TE role
also has “owner” privileges to all test plans, test procedures, product under test configuration
information, and test data. All company test engineering staff are assigned the TE role.

Company Management (CMgmt) — The CMgmt role has “‘owner” privileges to all the company sensitive
information to include Human Resources records, Payroll records, Project Management records, Legal
records, and personnel managers records to include the company Vice President and President records.
All company management staff are assigned the CMgmt role.

3.2 Information System Components Description.

The following subsections describe the information system equipment racks and the hardware and software installed
in the racks that will be part of the system under evaluation for this challenge. The company has developed a suite of
proprietary application software for their engineering and production, test engineering, and company management
work areas. The company asserts that the application software does not have any vulnerabilities, so the application
software will not be part of the system under evaluation for this challenge other than evaluating the criticality of the
functions the software performs. The challenge will be limited in scope to just the operating systems and specific
commercial tools used for cybersecurity.

3.2.1 Boundary Defense and System Administration Rack.

As illustrated in Figure 3.2.1-1, the company facility will have a Boundary Defense and System Administration Rack
that will include a Cisco Firepower Firewall with an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). All external network traffic
passing into or out of the facility will be routed through the Firewall and rulesets will be developed to only permit the
required data flows. The IPS will be updated periodically with the latest Cisco signatures in order to detect well
known cyber attacks, and specific alert types and automated response actions will be configured on the IPS by the
facility Information Technology (IT) System Administrator for each signature category. The rack will include a Cisco
Layer 3 Switch that will interconnect the internal rack components as well as provide the interface to the other
equipment racks within the facility. External network traffic that successfully passes through the Firewall will then
be routed through the Layer 3 Switch to the end node destination. The rack will include PowerEdge Servers with a
dedicated server for the Virtualization Management, Cybersecurity Capability and Tools, and Computer and Network
Audit Log Server functions. Each server will have a bulk data Storage Area Network (SANS) location. A built-in
monitor, keyboard, and track ball will be part of the equipment rack and will provide the location where the System
Administrator will configure and monitor the IT internal to the facility, perform cybersecurity tasks, and manage the
user accounts. It will also be the location where the Virtualization Management will be performed when virtual
machines are instantiated on the Server Racks for the production and test activities. A patch panel will provide a
central cable management point for all the internal equipment interconnection in the rack. It will also allow for easier
reconfiguration of the rack interconnect if it becomes necessary. The rack will include an Uninterruptible Power
Supply with a power conditioner that will provide emergency power backup in the event of a primary facility power
interruption.

The Cybersecurity Tools will consist of an Identity Management (IdM) server, a Splunk Security Information and
Event Manager (SIEM), McAfee Anti-Virus scanner, and Nessus vulnerability scanner to monitor the facility
operations and ensure the information systems are secure. The facility IT System Administrator will routinely monitor
the SIEM for cybersecurity alerts and will initiate internal cybersecurity tests, such as Anti-Virus scans and Nessus
vulnerability scans, of all installed IT in compliance with the company cybersecurity policy and procedures. The
facility System Administrator will also perform user account management from the Boundary Defense and System
Management rack through the IdM service. The System Administrator will validate all user accounts are still valid
and that each user has the appropriate roles assigned at least monthly per the company cybersecurity policy and
procedures.

3.3. System Critical Functions and Mapping.

The company information system provides fifteen functions that the product engineering and production, test
engineering, IT and cybersecurity, and company management work areas use. The criticality levels that are used
within this example are listed below but challenge participants may derive their own criticality scale and weighting
values.

 

e¢ High Criticality — The company must maintain all High criticality functions at all times to meeting vital
product development, test, and delivery to customers and to maintain timely customer support for fielded
products. There are also contractual and safety reasons for having to maintain all High criticality functions.
No interruption in critical functions is acceptable during cyber attacks on the company information system
from external threats or internal threats or during natural disasters. IT and cybersecurity services within the
company information system are considered High criticality.

e Medium Criticality — The company can accept partial or complete interruption of Medium criticality
functions for no longer then 1 month before it will begin impacting operations. Product development, test,
production, and fielding can still be completed but the process is slowed down and is more expensive when
medium criticality functions are degraded or denied for an extended period of time. Work arounds are
defined to continue company operations when Medium criticality functions are disrupted.

e Low Criticality — The company can accept long term degradation or denial of Low criticality functions. It
is considered a nuisance if Low criticality functions are not available but it will not impact product
development, test, production, and fielding in any way and will have minimum impact on company
management.

Table 3.3-1 lists the company critical functions that is provided by the company’s proprietary application software
that is installed on the workstations, laptops, and servers. A given function may execute on a single endpoint node
within the information system or it may be distributed across multiple nodes as illustrated in Table 3.3-2. The
computer network infrastructure components that interconnect all the nodes will also be critical for the distributed
functions to the highest criticality value of the functions that rely on the network components. Table 3.3-2 maps the
software functions to the information system endpoint nodes that are required to execute those functions. An “X” in
the matrix indicates that all or a portion of the function is executed on an endpoint. Once simple method for assessing
the criticality of an endpoint node (hardware and software) using the matrix mapping is to apply the “highwater mark”
technique. For a given node in Table 3-3-2, scan the row to find the “X” that is in the highest criticality column, and
that would be considered the highwater mark. For example, the Server Rack, Server #4 executes functions F4, F8,
and F9, and since F4 has a criticality value of “High” in Table 3.3-1, then the Server #4 criticality is also considered
“High”. Likewise, the Engineering & Production (Workstation 4) executes functions F7 and F11, and since function
F7 is assessed as Medium criticality in Table 3.3-1 while function F11 is assessed as Low criticality, the criticality of
Workstation 4 is Medium. There ae other techniques that can be used, so participants are encouraged to use their
preferred methods.
