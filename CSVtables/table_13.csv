"3.2  Information System Components Description."
"The following subsections describe the information system equipment racks and the hardware and software installed"
"in the racks that will be part of the system under evaluation for this challenge.  The company has developed a suite of"
"proprietary application software for their engineering and production, test engineering, and company management"
"work areas.  The company asserts that the application software does not have any vulnerabilities, so the application"
"software will not be part of the system under evaluation for this challenge other than evaluating the criticality of the"
"functions the software performs.  The challenge will be limited in scope to just the operating systems and specific"
"commercial tools used for cybersecurity."
"3.2.1  Boundary Defense and System Administration Rack."
"As illustrated in Figure 3.2.1-1, the company facility will have a Boundary Defense and System Administration Rack"
"that will include a Cisco Firepower Firewall with an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS).  All external network traffic"
"passing into or out of the facility will be routed through the Firewall and rulesets will be developed to only permit the"
"required data flows.  The IPS will be updated periodically with the latest Cisco signatures in order to detect well"
"known cyber attacks, and specific alert types and automated response actions will be configured on the IPS by the"
"facility Information Technology (IT) System Administrator for each signature category.  The rack will include a Cisco"
"Layer  3  Switch  that  will  interconnect  the  internal  rack  components  as  well  as  provide  the  interface  to  the  other"
"equipment racks within the facility.  External network traffic that successfully passes through the Firewall will then"
"be routed through the Layer 3 Switch to the end node destination.  The rack will include PowerEdge Servers with a"
"dedicated server for the Virtualization Management, Cybersecurity Capability and Tools, and Computer and Network"
"Audit Log Server functions.  Each server will have a bulk data Storage Area Network (SANS) location.  A built-in"
"monitor, keyboard, and track ball will be part of the equipment rack and will provide the location where the System"
"Administrator will configure and monitor the IT internal to the facility, perform cybersecurity tasks, and manage the"
"user  accounts.    It  will  also  be  the  location  where  the  Virtualization  Management  will  be  performed  when  virtual"
"machines are instantiated on the Server Racks for the production and test activities.  A patch panel will provide a"
"central cable management point for all the internal equipment interconnection in the rack.  It will also allow for easier"
"reconfiguration of the  rack interconnect if it becomes necessary.  The rack will include an Uninterruptible Power"
"Supply with a power conditioner that will provide emergency power backup in the event of a primary facility power"
"interruption."
"The Cybersecurity Tools will consist of an Identity Management (IdM) server, a Splunk Security Information and"
"Event  Manager  (SIEM),  McAfee  Anti-Virus  scanner,  and  Nessus  vulnerability  scanner  to  monitor  the  facility"
"operations and ensure the information systems are secure.  The facility IT System Administrator will routinely monitor"
"the SIEM for cybersecurity alerts and will initiate internal cybersecurity tests, such as Anti-Virus scans and Nessus"
"vulnerability scans, of all installed  IT in compliance with the company  cybersecurity policy and procedures.  The"
"facility System Administrator will also perform user account management from the Boundary Defense and System"
"Management rack through the IdM service.  The System Administrator will validate all user accounts are still valid"
"and  that  each  user  has  the  appropriate  roles  assigned  at  least  monthly  per  the  company  cybersecurity  policy  and"
"procedures."
