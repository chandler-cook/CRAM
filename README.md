# Overview
CRAM (Cyber Resiliency and Measurement) is a project developed as part of Tennessee Technological University's initiative for the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division's Cyber Resiliency and Measurement challenge.

The primary goal of CRAM is to analyze a given companyâ€™s cybersecurity posture and provide an evaluative score. The project is designed to assess the cyber resilience of an organization by gathering relevant data, evaluating vulnerabilities, and generating a score that reflects its ability to withstand cyber threats. This scoring mechanism aids in identifying areas for improvement and enhancing overall cybersecurity strategies.
