"Some additional company facility and information system characteristics to consider are:",""
"a.","Company facility is next to a river and is in the flood plain."
"b.","Company facility implements some physical security measures to include a Security Guard desk at the main"
"","entrance that is staffed Monday-Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.  The main entrance is locked when the Guard is"
"","not on duty but allows employees to exit if they work late (sometimes the door does not close all the way if"
"","employees do not make sure it catches).  The production staff are responsible for opening the production floor"
"","door in the morning and locking it at the end of each day using a key lock, and all production staff have the"
"","key.  An after-hours alarm system that only monitors the main entrance door and the production floor door is"
"","implemented and it is monitored by a commercial service over a telephone line link.  All employees know the"
"","alarm code in the event they need to work late or have to come into work over the weekend.  The last employee"
"","leaving the facility in the evening is responsible for activating the alarm."
"c.","Company has an equipment room that contains all the Information Technology (IT) equipment racks and the"
"","room has a single door with a key lock.  All the IT staff have the door key and the door is usually left unlock"
"","during normal business hours but it is supposed to be locked whenever there is no IT staff present in the room"
"","per the company policy.  The IT staff does not always lock the door if they step out and “expect” to be back in"
"","15 minutes or less.  The equipment racks in the space do not have locks and neither does the equipment spares"
"","cabinet."
"d.","Company has a room for the Engineering and Production staff and it has a single entrance door but there is not"
"","door lock or any other physical access control mechanism.  The believe is that the Security Guard at the main"
"","entrance will control visitors and all the company staff is trusted."
"e.","Company has a room for the product test and evaluation, and it has a single door but it is accessed through the"
"","Engineering  and  Production  room.    It  also  does  not  have  a  key  lock  or  any  other  physical  access  control"
"","mechanism."
"f.","Company Management offices are comprised of a suite of rooms that are accessed from a single door.  That"
"","door has a key lock to secure the office space after hours.  The door is unlocked during normal business hours"
"","but a PIN keypad is used to gain access.  The individual offices in the management suite do not have locks on"
"","their doors."
"g.","Assume the company Product floor is all Industrial Control System (ICS) components that is standalone with"
"","no computer network connections to the company information system under evaluation.  The production ICS"
"","is not part of this challenge.  There is a door between the Engineering and Production space and the Production"
"","floor.  It has a key lock but no one really uses it (and they can’t find the key) and there is no other physical"
"","access control mechanism being used."
"h.","The company uses proprietary application software for all the engineering and production, test engineering,"
"","and company management functions.  This proprietary application software will not be part of the system under"
"","evaluation for this challenge."
"i.","The  IT  staff  has  a  mix  of  training  and  experience.    Some  IT  staff  have  received  IT  and  cybersecurity"
"","certifications in the past but they have since expired.  Other staff have had some IT training but limited on-the-"
"","job  experience  and  they  have  had  no  cybersecurity  training.    One  IT  staff  member  has  years  of  IT  and"
"","cybersecurity  experience,  has  formal 
technical  education,  and  has  a  number  of  IT  and  cybersecurity"
"","certifications.    This  single  staff  member  seems  to  be  doing  the  vast  majority  of  the  work  and  they  are"
"","overworked.  They were hired into the company within the past 6 months to improve the information system"
"","security, but the system architecture is already deployed and there is no funding to make improvements until"
"","next year."
"j.","Information system boundary Firewall Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rulesets are not up-to-date."
"k.","Some of the hardware and software components within the company information system have reached “end-"
"","of-life”.  This means that the component manufacturer no longer supports the hardware or software item, and"
"","as a result will not provide security patches to firmware or software for any newly discovered vulnerabilities."
"l.","Nodes within the company information system have not had the latest security patches installed leaving open"
"","vulnerabilities.  Some vulnerabilities have been known for some time but can not be patched since some of the"
"","application software providing critical functions will stop working."
