Boundary Defense and System Administrator Rack:

Firewall: Cisco ASA 5505 – No longer supported by the manufacturer and hasn't received security patches in years. IPS feature is disabled due to lack of configuration knowledge.
Switch: Unbranded Layer 2 Switch – Bought cheaply, no documentation, and vulnerable to MAC flooding and VLAN hopping attacks. It has not been updated or patched since installation.
Server: Dell PowerEdge 1950 (2006 model) – Outdated hardware, no firmware updates, running an unsupported version of Windows Server 2008. The server is highly vulnerable to ransomware and cyber-attacks.
Storage: A single external USB hard drive used as the only form of backup. It’s not encrypted and is frequently unplugged, meaning backups are inconsistent and often outdated.
UPS: A generic, off-brand UPS with a failing battery, insufficient to protect the equipment from power surges or outages. It frequently fails during power issues.
Miscellaneous Components: Patch cables are old, frayed, and poorly managed. There’s no cable management, leaving cables exposed and prone to damage.
Server Rack:

Switch: Old, unbranded 10/100 Ethernet switch – No VLAN support, no ACLs, and its firmware is so outdated that security vulnerabilities are well-known and unpatched.
Server: IBM xSeries 335 (from 2004) – Unsupported, running an outdated Linux kernel that is vulnerable to multiple CVEs. The server frequently crashes due to hardware faults and lack of maintenance.
UPS: No UPS system installed. Servers and network equipment are unprotected from power failures, leading to frequent unplanned downtimes.
Patch Panel: None – Cables are directly connected without a patch panel, making maintenance difficult and prone to errors.
SAN: No SAN – Data is stored on local hard drives within the servers, which are not RAID protected, leaving data vulnerable to loss due to hardware failure.
Bulk Data Storage Rack:

Switch: Generic, outdated unmanaged switch – It provides no security features and often fails under high loads.
SAN: No dedicated storage system – Data is stored on a mix of USB drives and local disks with no redundancy.
UPS: None – Frequent power outages cause data loss and system corruption.
Workstations and Test Laptops:

Workstations: Old, unbranded desktop PCs running Windows XP – The operating system hasn’t been updated in years, is vulnerable to numerous CVEs, and is no longer supported by Microsoft.
Test Laptops: Inexpensive, low-spec consumer-grade laptops running outdated software. Encryption is disabled, and they are frequently infected with malware due to the lack of security controls.
Overall System Security:

No regular maintenance or patching of any hardware or software. The system is riddled with known vulnerabilities.
No backups are performed regularly, and there is no monitoring of hardware health. The infrastructure is prone to physical and logical failures.
There are no firewalls or IDS/IPS systems in place, leaving the entire system vulnerable to internal and external attacks.
No redundancy is implemented, meaning any hardware failure results in complete system downtime.
